OpenStack Ansible Workshop

[OpenStack Ansible (OSA)](https://docs.openstack.org/openstack-ansible/latest/) provides Ansible playbooks and roles for the deployment and configuration of an OpenStack environment. This workshop deploys the bare metal hardware required for two node OSA atop the [Packet](http://www.packet.com/) bare metal cloud and builds the required OSA configuration files using [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/). This allows you access to a real, bare metal, OpenStack Ansible cloud all set up and running. This allows you to get familiar with a running OSA cloud without having to go through all the trouble of setting up your own environment. While OSA does offer an "All in One" (AIO) deployment in a virtualized environment, a full multi-node environment on bare metal allows for a more complete experience when trying out the cloud.

If you are attending this workshop in person, please proceed to [Lab01](Lab01.md). For in person workshops, we've taken the liberty to predeploy you a dedicate cloud environment.

If you're looking to run this workshop remotely, you'll need an environment to clone this GitHub repo and run Terraform. For more details, please see [Building your own Lab](terraform/Readme.md)
